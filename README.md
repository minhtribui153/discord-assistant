## Google Assistant Discord Bot

> ⚠️ This Google Assistant Project is not fully developed yet. A full version will be shown in the future.

## How it works
This Google Assistant Discord Bot will retrieve the input from Discord Users and send to the Google Assistant API. When processed, the Google Assistant API will send a response to the Discord Bot, in which the Discord bot will send a message back to the Discord User.

```
